## About

CFW Installer is obviously a troll app. It uses troll value of `sceKernelSetIccBuzzer();` which can be found in `libkernel.h` header file. Basically console does not stop "beeping" until you turn off the console.  It does some very simple drawing on scene and It has input so I don't need to turn off my console every time I want to move something for few pixel. It also uses `MsgDialog.h` for displaying some important stuff and one only friendly message in this program. Source is obviously here on the repo  and I even included the `.xfc` GIMP project files and assets used for making of `icon0.png`, `pic0.png` , `icon0` without background gradient and other... PS4 `.pkg` file can be found in releases tab here [here](https://github.com/Roko191/CFW-Installer).

## Why?

Obviously main reason is to troll be people because 90% of scene members don't know what the fuck they are doing. They blindly follow tutorials without any knowledge and all they do is ask for new jailbreak, pirated games and of course CFW... I think some of them will realize to not trust everything and always check because not every homebrew is good. Some of them can brick sys, at least I think...
